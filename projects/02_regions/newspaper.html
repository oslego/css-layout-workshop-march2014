    <h1>CSS Regions</h1>
    <p>
      With Regions, you can use CSS properties to flow content into existing styled containers, specifying any container order you choose, regardless of their position on the page. Create visually stunning responsive layouts for mobile and desktop content today.
    </p>
    <p>
      By allowing text to automatically flow from one box to another, CSS Regions bring the power and flexibility of complex layout to the web. This makes it easier to build pages with layout similar to traditional newspapers and magazines, but it goes beyond that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regions work by disconnecting the visual rendering of elements from their order in the DOM. This gives a hint to a potential new use case â€“ building adaptive UI for web applications. I do emphasize on the adaptive term because this accounts for the user and device context.
