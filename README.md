## Self-directed learning

Learning by doing is fun!

The folders with exercises are named like `01\_flexbox`, `02\_regions`, and so forth. Open them in your code editor of choice.

Each folder contains a few HTML files as exercises to learn about a specific thing. In every HTML there is a `<style>` tag with CSS and instructions. They're easy to follow. Look for this format:
  
    /*STEP 1*/ 
    /*Set property: value; to learn something new. */ 

The CSS in the `<style>` contains the essential bits for learning at each stage. Some demos also have linked stylesheets. Those may contain supporting code that make the demo look nice. They're out of sight to keep you focused.
  
A version of the each completed exercise lives one level lower, in the `_complete/` folder. Peek in there to see the result.
